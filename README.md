# Seaborn_and_Linear_Regression
Linear Regression and Data Visualisation with Seaborn

That was a pretty packed lesson with a lot of new concepts introduced. We looked at how to:

<ul>
  <li>Use nested loops to remove unwanted characters from multiple columns</li>
  <li>Filter Pandas DataFrames based on multiple conditions using both .loc[] and .query()</li>
  <li>Create bubble charts using the Seaborn Library</li>
  <li>Style Seaborn charts using the pre-built styles and by modifying Matplotlib parameters</li>
  <li>Use floor division (i.e., integer division) to convert years to decades</li>
  <li>Use Seaborn to superimpose a linear regressions over our data</li>
  <li>Make a judgement if our regression is good or bad based on how well the model fits our data and the r-squared metric</li>
  <li>Run regressions with scikit-learn and calculate the coefficients.</li>
</ul>
